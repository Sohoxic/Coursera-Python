### More About Python

**Using Python on your own**

The best way to learn any programming language is to practice it on your own as much as you can. If you have Python installed on your computer, you can execute the interpreter by running the python3 command (or just python on Windows), and you can close it by typing exit() or Ctrl-D.

If you don’t already have Python installed on your machine, that’s alright. We’ll explain how to install it in an upcoming course.

**Python practice resources**

In the meantime, you can still practice by using one of the many online Python interpreters or codepads available online. There’s not much difference between an interpreter and a codepad. An interpreter is more interactive than a codepad, but they both let you execute code and see the results.

Below, you’ll find links to some of the most popular online interpreters and codepads. Give them a go to find your favorite.

**Additional Python resources**

While this course will give you information about how Python works and how to write scripts in Python, you’ll likely want to find out more about specific parts of the language. Here are some great ways to help you find additional info: 

- Read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">official Python documentation.</a>.

- Search for answers or ask a question on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow. 

- Subscribe to the <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor">Python tutor</a> mailing list, where you can ask questions and collaborate with other Python learners.

- Subscribe to the <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/python-announce-list.python.org/">Python-announce</a> mailing list to read about the latest updates in the language.

**Python history and current status**

Python was released almost 30 years ago and has a rich history. You can read more about it on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python">History of Python</a> Wikipedia page or in the section on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/license.html">history of the software</a> from the official Python documentation.

Python has recently been called the fastest growing programming language. If you're interested in why this is and how it’s measured, you can find out more in these articles:

### A Note on Syntax and Code Blocks

When writing code, using correct syntax is super important. Even a small typo, like a missing parentheses or an extra comma, can cause a syntax error and the code won't execute at all. Yikes. If your code results in an error or an exception, pay close attention to syntax and watch out for minor mistakes.

If your syntax is correct, but the script has unexpected behavior or output, this may be due to a semantic problem. Remember that syntax is the rules of how code is constructed. Semantics are the meaning of coded statements. What is the code meaning to accomplish? It is possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, but doesn't do what we want it to do.

When working with the code blocks in exercises for this course, be mindful of syntax errors, along with the overall result of your code. Just because you fixed a syntax error doesn't mean that the code will have the desired effect when it runs! Once you’ve fixed an error in your code, don't forget to submit it to have your work checked.

# Practice assignment 1
**1.** Fill in the correct Python command to put “My first Python program” onto the screen.
```
print("My first Python program")
```
**2.** Python is an example of what type of programming language?
```
General purpose scripting language 
```
**3.** Convert this Bash command into Python: echo Have a nice day
```
print("Have a nice day")
```
**4.** Fill in the correct Python commands to put “This is fun!” onto the screen 5 times. 
```
for i in range(5):
  print("This is fun!")
```
**5.** Select the Python code snippet that corresponds to the following Javascript snippet:

> for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }

```
for i in range(10):
  print(i)

```
